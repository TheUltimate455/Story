<h1>Princess Molly and the Pony</h1>
<p>Once a upon a time, a Princess named Molly was in trouble because she got mud.
All over herself, "And that's not all," said her mother, the Queen. "You've been galloping on those ponies again! "Princesses must not gallop," the King said, crossly. "Ever!" "Being a princess is boring," said Princess Molly. "I can't do ANYTHING." "You could show us your princess wave," said the Queen. "Or try on your tiaras?" said the King. "But no galloping!" they cried together."But I 
Love Ponies and Galloping" said Princess Molly, instead of listening her father took her to the "Crown Room" to try on fancy tiaras and Princess Molly did
not enjoy it. </p>
